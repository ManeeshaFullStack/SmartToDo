# SmartToDo

> A responsive, interactive to-do list application built with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3, designed to strengthen practical knowledge in client-side scripting, local storage, and DOM manipulation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**SmartToDo** is a frontend-only dynamic task management app that allows users to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks. It uses **localStorage** to persist tasks even after refreshing or closing the browser — simulating real-world functionality in productivity tools.

> ✅  **This project was developed to build hands-on experience in JavaScript and jQuery, especially for DOM manipulation, event handling, and using browser-based localStorage. It also enhanced my understanding of structuring responsive layouts with HTML and CSS.**
